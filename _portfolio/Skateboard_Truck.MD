**What is Generative Design** 
* Generative Design is a design tool where the program generates designs based around certain geometries provided by the designer. Usually, the geomtries provided are preserve and obstacle geometries. Preserve geometries are designs that can not be modified but need to be part of the final design. Obstacle geometries are designs that the program has to generate a design around. Constraint geometries are used to prevent certain regions of the model from being used. 

* Generative design is used to reduce time and costs while exploring new ideas and design methods. Various design iterations are presented by the program and based on certain criteria the user can select a specific iteration to further modify using traditional CAD tools. 

**What is SlS Printing**
* SLS, Selective Laser Sintering, is a 3D printing technology that uses the melting of powdered material, typically a thermoplastic polymer such as nylon for 3D printing. A laser along with the bed is used to fuse and melt the pellets. After each layer is sintered, the bed lowers and the remaining powder is brushed off, then another layer is added to repeat the process. One benefit of SLS is that there is no support material required which allows many different types of geometries to be printed. This paired with great mechanical properties results in stronger parts. 

**SLS Printed Truck**
* The main benefits of SLS printing include the ability to print complex designs since there is no dependency on the usage of supports. Further different geometries can be printed such as overhangs and underc cuts without additional processes. SLS technology is also known for having the ability to reuse unused powder. Usually, the ratio of unused to sued pellets is 70% to 30%. this not only reduces material usage but costs as well as barely giving up any mechanical strength.

**More About Generative Design**
* Generative design is a great tool that is used in many industries such as aerospace, automation, architecture, and even healthcare. The main attraction for the usage of generative design includes different design choices and reduction of time and material usage. In aerospace, lightweight and durable components with applied forces can be modeled to ensure safe and accurate application.

* Generative design is useful when trying to save time in money however sometimes the return on investment is not good. When using generative design, there are a lot of thigns that need to be considered especially things like preserve and obstacle geometries. When designing intricate parts that have many forces that could applied in different directions, developing the obstacle geometries and preserve may end up taking longer then using traditional CAD modeling techniques. Even if the design seems to be satisfactory, there could be some asjutments to be made in the post processing process in CAD which adds time. Another draw back would be the time it takes for the model to finish generating. SOme might suggest starting the generation and moving on to a different task until the generation is finished or even starting it at night. However, if the process is contingent on the design this delays the progress and development. Even more of a bigger issue would be if the generation is started and can not converge which wastes time. This is similar to the preview function where designs between the preview function and the final generation are not accurate at all. 
* This method of design is very useful if the designer is looking for different design methods with certain constraints. It is also useful when analyzing forces to generate the design since it ensures that the component won't fail. However, applying the forces accurately and making sure the design isn't not being over-generated or obstructive is a big concern. 

**Pairing of Generative Design and SLS Printing**
* Generative design is useful in aerospace applications since it saves time and money due to reduced weight and material usage. With these benefits, the final product has a lower fuel consumption rate and higher durability which enhances performance and safety. With less stress on the mechanical components, there are lower repair costs and less maintenance to be done. 

* Generative design is used for aircraft wings, fuselages, jet engines, and turbines optimized for weight, strength, and aerodynamics.

* Unique pairing of powder bed fusion and generative allows for complex and durable components to be produced. SLS printed materials have great strength and durability. This paired with optimized material usage and powder recyclability leads to efficient and effective products. The roots of generative design offer cost-saving and time-reducing action which is further emphasized by the strategic printing capabilities of SLS technology.  This maximizes the performance and functionality leading of the components.
