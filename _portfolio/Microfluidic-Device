# Discription of Microfluidic Device

* **Design and Purpose** "Syringe pumps are highly accurate, and with a continuous flow of liquid, they allow for sterility. This pump only has a motor, lead screw, basic computer coding, and housing, which leads to a simple design while being incredibly useful. However, even lower-end syringe pumps can cost thousands of dollars; therefore, custom fabrication is economically advisable. With buttons that allow for manual movement of the pump, as well as continuous movement with a set dial, this pump can reliably push fluids. The pump comes with an auto-shutoff feature with light indicators that allow for ease of use. The pump has an output rate that is accurate within 0.1 uL."

# Operating Instructions

* Automatic Use
  1. Extend the carriage
  2. Simultaneously, lower the full syringe while adjusting the distance of the Flange Holder (carriage) to fit
  3. Slowly lower the syringe to fit into the Flange Holder, make sure the plunger is inserted into the Plunger Holder 
  4. Double the tip is resting in the Tip Support Groove
  4. Adjust the desired flow rate using the dial or enter value in the program
  6. Automated Use
  7. Adjust desired flow rate 
  8. Hit the Red Button with the silver Casing
* Manual Use
  1. Hit the third button for forward movement
  2. Hit the fourth button for backward movement
