# Discription

* **Design and Purpose** Syringe pumps are highly accurate and with continuous flow of liquid allwos for sterility. This pump only has a motor, lead screw, basic computer coding, and a housing, which leads to a simple design while being incredibly useful. However, even lower end syringe pums can cost thousadns of dollars, therfore custom fabrication is economcially advisable. With buttons tahta llwo for manual movment fo the pump as wella s continous movment with set dial, this pump can relaiably push fluids. this pump comes iwth auto shut off feature with light indicators that allows for ease of use. The pump has an output rate that is accuate within .1 uL.

# Operating Instructions

* Automatic Use
  1. Extend the carriage
  2.  Simultaneously, lower the full syringe while adjusting the distance of the Flange Holder (carriage) to fit
  3. Slowly lower the syringe to fit into the Flange Holder, make sure plunger is inserted into the Plunger Holder 
  4. Double chek tip is resting in the Tip Support Groove
  4. Adjust desired flow rate suing dial or enter value in Program
  6. Automated Use
  7. Adjust desired flow rate 
  8. Hit Red Button with silver Casing
* Manual use
  1. Hit third button for forward movement
  2. Hit fourth button for backwards movement
