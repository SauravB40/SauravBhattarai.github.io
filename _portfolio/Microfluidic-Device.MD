**What are Microfluidic Devices?** 
* Microfluidic Devices are small boards with circuit-like channels that allow for analysis of the physical and chemical properties of fluids. With channels as small as 60-micrometer fluids can be analyzed at a microscale, reducing reagent and sample consumption and in turn resulting in cheaper tests. These devices can be used in several different applications such as medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, tissue engineering, and even environmental testing.

**Cancer Detection using Microfluidic Devices**
* Microfluidic Devices have many applications, one of the most influential being cancer detection. Most Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are larger than healthy cells, these devices can isolate these cells based on their size using microscale filters and precise pore sizes. These pore sizes allow healthy cells and blood serum to pass through but capture these CTCs. Furthermore, Density-Based separation can be used to separate CTCs from the blood with density gradients, the sedimentation rate for Tumor cells will differ greatly from healthy cells. These devices could also incorporate immunogenic techniques for isolating Cancer cells by flowing blood through channels with antibodies that can bind. These antibodies could be tagged with some maker-like fluorescents which would allow for visual analysis.

**Challenges with Mixing Fluids in Microfluidic Devices**
* One of the biggest challenges of Microfluidic Devices comes with what is so great about these devices: The size. The channels in these devices allow for the transport, sorting, and mixing of reagents at a small volume. However, the flow characteristic of liquids in small volumes is Laminar Flow. The fluids do not experience turbulent flow or mixing, but mixing is important for performing biological assays. For example, antibodies might not interact with the blood sample as well or if at all which will reduce the detection rate from the example above since diffusion is the only medium of mixing. To combat this caveat, the correction area has to be increased, altering the surface area to volume ratio to promote mixing. The cross-sectional area is increased through geometries like serpentine path, splitting flow paths, adding sharp corners, Herringbone, Chevron, and inclined mixers to introduce Chaotic Advection.

**Process of Creating a Microfluidic Device: From a 3D Printed Mold to the Final Device**
* This Microfluidic Device was made using 3D printing technique called Steriolithrogaphy (SLA) which involves using UV light to photopolymerize resin. The first step si to desng a mold usign a computer-aided design (CAD) software. Most designs includes features that encourge Chaotic Adveciton so that mixing occur within the channels. Many materials can eb 3D printed hwoever SLA is suerpio method compared to other 3D pritnign tehcnogly as it offers high resolutions, smooth surfaces, conssitnet layering, and realtively faster opritnign speed. These charateristscs allow for incorporation of fine detials liek channels, dviots, and geotmeies which are ruired fo rmxing in these devices. 
* Using SLA, the resin is cured using UV light in a layer by layer fashion. After the all the alyers have been created and solidified, then the post processing of this modl beings. Hte psot porcessign involes wahsing resin and the curing any resin that is left behind. This proces ssually takes anywhere between five to 10 mintues. 
* After the curing and washing, the mold goes through Parylene Coating. This coating allwos for easier removal of cast PDMS. It also impoves surface quality as it maeks the mold more hydrophobic and biocompatible. this reduces cytoxity and otehr adverse reactiosn that might occur durign the testing of samples and mixng of biolgicla reagents. THe coating voerall icnreases the lifespan of the mold, many more devices cna be fabricated without the worry of the mold degrading or beign altered. The coatign could also be applied to the device itself. The coating allwos fo rthe device to be biocmaptlbe and reduce adverse reactions. Fruther, it adds to the durblitya nd lifespan fo the device as it protects the deivce form ahrsh fluids, leakage and contantiantion, as well as preventing wear and tear.
* Plasma bonding could also be sued to sela Micorlfudic Devices. When using Plasma, the device is exposed to low-pressure plasma to enourage bdning to elminate leaks.

**Mixing Sections**
* On the Left side of the device, the design principle for the mixing section included a series of splitting flow paths, sharp corners, and inclined mixers to introduce Chaotic Advection. When the fluid enters the device, it comes into contact with another and splits into one pathway. Here the contact and turn allow for contact and mixing. After this conversion, the path has a series of inclined mixers (4), which disrupt the parallel flow further. These inclined mixers were made with half triangles at a width and a height of 1 mm. After this chaotic short distance, the paths diverge, and then each path goes through a sharp turn inducing Chaotic Advection. pathway after the mixers are at a height and width of .5 mm. The individual channels then converge into a larger channel increasing the cross-sectional area which introduces another round of chaotic fluid behavior. The fluid then goes through a series of conversions and diversions and a final turn to fully mix with one another. These paths have a width and height of 1mm. 

* On the Right side of the device, the design principle for the mixing section involved incorporating an inclined configuration paired with a zig-zag pattern. When the two fluids converge for mixing initiation, they traverse through the inclined mixing segment. Subsequently, the fluid progresses through a zig-zag segment before encountering another inclined portion, followed by another zig-zag. This alternating pattern aims to provide numerous opportunities for the fluids to intermix effectively. The corners of the zig-zag feature a 60Â° angle, facilitating mixing at the extremities. Additionally, the recesses in the inclined mixing segment aid in disrupting fluid flow uniformity, thereby enhancing mixing. Dimensional specifications were determined by assessing the capacity for accommodating bends in the zig-zag pattern and divots within my portion of the uFluidic device. The divots in the inclined mixing sections, measuring 1 mm in length, width, and height were chosen to strike a balance between size and mixing efficiency.
